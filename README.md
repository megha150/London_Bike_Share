# London Bike Ride Analysis and Dashboard
## Overview
This data analytics project explores the London Bike Sharing dataset obtained from Kaggle. The goal is to gain insights into bike usage patterns and answer specific questions related to weather impact, total bike rides between periods, moving averages, and improving visualizations for better user experience.

## Key Questions Explored
1. How does weather affect bike usage?<br>
2. What's the total bike rides between specific periods?<br>
3. What's the 2-week moving average? (7-day/30-day moving average)<br>
4. How can you make your visuals more dynamic and user-friendly?

## Dashboard
Following is the link to access my dashboard on Tableau Public:
"https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/megha.4731/viz/London_bike_visual/Londonbikes" <br>
You can hover over the heatmap and linechart to further see the 'weather' and 'hour of time' data, and you can also change the 'moving average period' and 'moving average duration' by selecting the specifics required.<br>
<br>
The dashboard would appear like this:

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [London Bike Sharing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset) from Kaggle. It includes following columns after some data exploration and manipulation:<br>
1. time <br>            
2. count <br>              
3. temp_real_C  <br>     
4. temp_feels_like_C <br>
5. humidity_percent <br>
6. wind_speed_kph  <br>
7. weather  <br>   
8. is_holiday <br>
9. is_weekend <br>
10. season <br>

## Key Findings:
Impact of Weather on Bike Usage:<br>
Bike rides tend to decrease during adverse weather conditions, such as rain or snow. Clear and mild weather correlates with increased bike usage.<br>
<br>
Total Bike Rides Between Specific Periods:<br>
The total number of bike rides significantly increases during weekends compared to weekdays. Seasonal trends show a surge in bike rides during the summer months.<br>
<br>
Moving Average:<br>
The 2-week moving average reveals a steady increase in bike rides over the analyzed period. Variations in the moving average can be attributed to seasonal changes and events.
